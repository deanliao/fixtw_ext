This is a Chrome extension used to make fixtw.com easier to use.

It can:

1. Extract license plate numbers from image filename (I used to write the plate numbers as part of a image/video filename.)
2. Store form content when submitting the case.
3. Provide a "load form" action to restore last uploaded form content.
4. Automatically removes zip code of an address.

TODO:
May provide recent comment as dropdown or auto-complete?

This is a Chrome extension used to speed up case submission for fixtw.com.

It can:

1. remove zip code when pasting an address;
1. store form content when submitting the case;
1  load previous stored form content when clicking "Load form" link;
1. extract license plate numbers and date-time from image filenames by clicking "Extract license plates & datetime" link.

When exporting the edited video clip, you can add license plate(s) and event timestamp to the video clip's filename.
The extension can extract the pattern and fill the form for you.

p.s. 
License plate number's regular expression: "[a-zA-Z0-9]+-[a-zA-Z0-9]+".
Datetime string (YYYYMMDDhhmm)'s regular expression: (\d{4})(\d\d)(\d\d)(\d\d)(\d\d)
